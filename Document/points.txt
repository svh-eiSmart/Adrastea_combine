1) Was testing SPI and I2C done using only Adrastea or using it on a Adrastea Evaluation kit or with M0?

just to be sure is the manual sent by ravindra corerect for reference
show code by adi on vscode
2) Why to use SDK? What part of the SDK development to be done using SDK and what part directly from the VS Code platform?

3) was sensor feather wings module data collected by the adrastea mod? As in github

3) Create files on Adrastea using functions by Adi

4) what is the connection between adrastea and M0?

1)in cfg file from certgen tool, "modelId": "dtmi:we:sensor:SensorFeatherWing;1",
2) upload all 6 files including azdevrootca to calypso after connecting to its SSID
3) In IoT Central -> permissions > Dewvice connection groups add the azdevcert (Root CA will appear after uploading)
4) Maybe use same name in device connection group as deviceID and template
5) change SCOPE_ID in PnP_device.h and model_ID to dtmi:we:sensor:SensorFeatherWing;1
